        Information about tactics can be derived from accounts of battles, but the very military manuals known to have
        existed and to have been used extensively by commanders, have not survived. Perhaps the greatest loss is the
        book of
        Sextus Julius Frontinus. But parts of his work were incorporated in the records of the historian Vegetius.

        The importance of the choice of ground is pointed out.
        There is an advantage of height over the enemy and if you are pitting infantry against cavalry, the rougher the
        ground the better. The sun should be behind you to dazzle the enemy. If there is strong wind it should blow away
        from you, giving advantage to your missiles and blinding the enemy with dust.
